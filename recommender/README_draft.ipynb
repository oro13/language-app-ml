    "- unveil certain supported languages gradually, after enough quality content has been contributed during an 'alpha' testing period\n",
    "- watch for fairness metrics concerning latent biases in content and recommendations, particularly in languages from areas with ethnic conflict, hegemonic power struggles/propaganda, etc\n",
    "- seek expert advice\n",
    "- make models specifically for 'average users' of different clusters, \n",
    "    - consider demographics and observe quality of recommendation\n",
    "- include content from underrespresented groups in corpus so low volume deters it from being considered"
